    <h2>How do I get around with Big Red?</h2>
    <p>
      Just text me at <strong>405-378-4024</strong> and I’ll let you know if I’m available.

  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
    <p>
      Standard rides start at <strong>$10</strong> (includes up to 10 miles).<br>
      Longer trips are <strong>$1.25 per mile for miles 11–20</strong> and <strong>$1.00 per mile</strong> beyond 20.<br><br>
      Rush Hour and Airport base fares are <strong>$15</strong>, and Special Events are <strong>$20</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>Travel Fairness Rule:</strong> A $10 travel fee may apply for pickups 1–15 miles outside my local area,  
      or $20 for 16 miles or more. Long trips already covering distance don’t incur this fee.
