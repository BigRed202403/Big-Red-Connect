  <h1>Rider Agreement – Big Red Connect</h1>
  <p>By riding with Big Red Connect, you agree to the following policies. These are displayed in-vehicle, on our website, and shared at time of booking:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Due as agreed. Missed or late payment may result in refusal of service.</li>
    <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> Cancel at least 3 hours in advance for refund eligibility.</li>
    <li><strong>No-Shows:</strong> $5 fee after 5-minute wait.</li>
    <li><strong>Stops/Changes:</strong> May result in a $5 fee per extra stop or major detour.</li>
    <li><strong>Damage or Mess:</strong> Fees up to $200 may apply for required cleaning or repairs.</li>
    <li><strong>Group Responsibility:</strong> The booking party is responsible for the behavior and costs of all group members.</li>
    <li><strong>Insurance Disclaimer:</strong> Rides are offered by an independent operator under a personal auto policy with a rideshare endorsement. This is not a licensed commercial or taxi service. Limited liability applies.</li>
    <li><strong>Dash Cam Notice:</strong> Audio and video may be recorded inside the vehicle for safety and liability purposes. Riding implies consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Voluntary Participation:</strong> All rides are voluntary and at your own risk. Big Red Connect is not liable for loss, injury, or damages unless caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct.</li>
    <li><strong>Travel Fairness Rule:</strong> A flat travel fee may apply for pickups outside the local service area — $10 for 1–15 miles beyond, $20 for 16 miles or more. Long trips that already cover travel time and mileage do not incur additional fees.</li>
    <li><strong>Loyalty Consistency:</strong> If you receive a quoted fare (e.g., $10 local) and request a return trip within the same night, that same rate will normally be honored for fairness and consistency. However, if the return trip occurs during a <em>special rate period</em> (Rush Hour, Airport, or Special Event / Concert traffic), the applicable base rate for that period may apply. You will always be quoted up front before confirming your return ride.</li>
  </ul>
